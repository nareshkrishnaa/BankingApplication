# BankingApplication
JAVA GUI Application for a Banking Software.
 I developed a banking application with a GUI using jSwing in the NetBeans IDE. The application provides users with a GUI for all banking operations, starting from opening an account to depositing money, making transactions, and obtaining statements of past transactions. The application is connected to a MySQL database for storing, retrieving, and modifying customer data, as well as keeping track of transactions.
